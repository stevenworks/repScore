# 🏆 repScore

**Consistency is your clout.**  
RepScore is a social accountability app that turns your grind into a score — track your habits, log your reps, and share your progress with the world.

## 🚀 What is RepScore?

RepScore is a public **consistency tracker** that gives you a score based on how often you show up — whether that’s the gym, studying, meditating, or building your empire.

- 🧠 **Log reps**: Workouts, study sessions, habits, grind hours
- 🔥 **Earn streaks**: Stay consistent and stack daily reps
- 📈 **Get a RepScore**: Calculated based on recent performance
- 🪪 **Share your RepCard**: Public profile to flex your consistency
- 🏆 **Compete with others**: See where you stand on the leaderboard

Think **Strava for discipline.**  
Think **BitClout meets habits.**  
Think **real flex culture** — built on showing up, not showing off.
